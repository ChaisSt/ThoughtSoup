This mobile app was created as a group project in my final semester of college. While I may continue working with it, all future changes will be on a separate repository.

Thought Soup was my first experience with SignalR and WPF and, while I'm still very fuzzy on SignalR, I do really like the direction that I took the design. The idea came from the old chatroom apps that seem to have disappeared in the last 20 years, the design is supposed to give the user a "Saturday night out" vibe. 

In its current state, it does not actually run online but it does allow two applications on the same computer to chat back and forth in real time. I would like to work more on this app to improve my knowledge of SignalR, making the app function between separate computers and allowing the user to message specific users privately.
